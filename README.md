How?
---

1. Scrape a list of all pokémons.
2. Use GitHub API and search for every pokémon name.
3. Get a matching repository name with highest number of stars.
4. 💥💥💥

Dev
---

- `npm i` - install dependencies
- `npm run pokemon` - grab the pokémons
- `npm run repokemon` - grab the Github repos
  - Copy `config.sample.json` to `config.json`, configure it with `client_id` and `client_secret` from GitHub
  - Takes about 30 minutes to prevent API rate limit issues
- `npm run stats` - show stats of the collected data
- `npm run images` - download all pokémon images to `data/images` (not included in this repo)
- `npm run sprite` - generate a sprite image `data/pokemon.png` (not included in this repo), which I manually convert to `data/pokemon.jpg`.
